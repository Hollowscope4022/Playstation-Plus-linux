# What is Playstation Plus?
Playstation Plus is a sony subscription service that allows you to stream Playstation 3/4/5 games to your windows pc. It also gives you access to online play and cloud storage, etc. To use Playstaion Plus for game streaming you do need a sony account and to have paid for either the PS Plus extra or the PS Plus Premium plans. This will not work if you don't have either of those. Also do not get the essentials plan as it does not include game streaming as an option. [See sony's website](https://www.playstation.com/en-us/ps-plus/#subscriptions) for more details on a ps plus plan.

# Getting started
After making a sony account or loggin in, it might be a little unclear where to go after you purchase PS plus, sometimes thier site will redirect you to a download for PS plus's .exe and sometimes it doesn't. If you need the PS Plus.exe you can get it [here](https://download-psplus.playstation.com/downloads/psplus/pc/latest)
Next you're going to need a peice of software called Lutris. Lutris is a manager for your games/proton/wine versions. If you are unfamiliar with wine or proton, those are compatibility layers that allow .exe files or windows programs to run on linux, it's a pretty good tool to use but it's not perfect. Everything on wine or proton requires some form of tweaking if it doesn't work, And that's why it's important if you want PS Plus to run that you set this up exactly how I do. Don't worry it's not hard lol. You can find a link to Lutris [here](https://lutris.net/downloads) make sure you get the version meant for your distro.

# Installing PS Plus on Lutris
Upon running Lutris for the first time you will be welcomed by a window similar to what you see in my image below. Again this can manage a ton of games including steam and epic as well as ubisoft, but let's not get off track. First thing you're gonna wanna do is to go to the sidebar on the left and click on wine if you don't already have that selected. Next click on the little icon left of the settings cog and install "Lutris-7.2-2. This is the best version of wine that iv'e gotten PS Plus to run with, it shouldn't crash or have any issues. If you do encounter any issues please let me know. Go ahead and close out of that menu after wine is done installing. Next go ahead and click on the plus button on the top left of Lutris, it will open the add game menu, click add locally installed game, Next we are going to give lutris all the info and settings PS Plus needs. In the name field type in a name of your choice that you want the game to appear as in your main menu, mine is "ps plus". Then open the runner drop down menu and select wine.
Next navigate to the Game options tab, and click browse on the executable section. From there navigate to where you downloaded your PS Plus setup.exe and select it.
