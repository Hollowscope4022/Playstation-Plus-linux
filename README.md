# What is Playstation Plus?
Playstation Plus is a sony subscription service that allows you to stream Playstation 3/4/5 games to your windows pc. It also gives you access to online play and cloud storage, etc. To use Playstaion Plus for game streaming you do need a sony account and to have paid for either the PS Plus extra or the PS Plus Premium plans. This will not work if you don't have either of those. Also do not get the essentials plan as it does not include game streaming as an option. [See sony's website](https://www.playstation.com/en-us/ps-plus/#subscriptions) for more details on a ps plus plan.

# Getting started
After making a sony account or loggin in, it might be a little unclear where to go after you purchase PS plus, sometimes thier site will redirect you to a download for PS plus's .exe and sometimes it doesn't. If you need the PS Plus.exe you can get it [here](https://download-psplus.playstation.com/downloads/psplus/pc/latest)
Next you're going to need a peice of software called Lutris. Lutris is a manager for your games/proton/wine versions. If you are unfamiliar with wine or proton, those are compatibility layers that allow .exe files or windows programs to run on linux, it's a pretty good tool to use but it's not perfect. Everything on wine or proton requires some form of tweaking if it doesn't work, And that's why it's important if you want PS Plus to run that you set this up exactly how I do. Don't worry it's not hard lol. You can find a link to Lutris [here](https://lutris.net/downloads) make sure you get the version meant for your distro.
