# What is Playstation Plus?
Playstation Plus is a sony subscription service that allows you to stream Playstation 3/4/5 games to your windows pc. It also gives you access to online play and cloud storage, etc. To use Playstaion Plus for game streaming you do need a sony account and to have paid for either the PS Plus extra or the PS Plus Premium plans. This will not work if you don't have either of those. Also do not get the essentials plan as it does not include game streaming as an option. [See sony's website](https://www.playstation.com/en-us/ps-plus/#subscriptions) for more details on a ps plus plan.
